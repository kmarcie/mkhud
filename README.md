=========

A hud for Team Fortress 2.
Please don't add me for questions about this HUD. Ask them in the Git discussion or TFtv thread.

Notes
------------

If you are planning to release a HUD with some of my assets, please give credit where credit is due.

TargetIDs look better if you use ```tf_hud_target_id_disable_floating_health 1```.

Crosshair
--------------
The custom crosshair is manageable through HudPlayerClass.res. I made it like this so when you are dead/in scoreboard/freezecam the crosshair doesn't show up, where as if I put it in hudlayout.res it would show up all the time.

Resolution Support
----------
16:9 - Yes. Looks the best on 1920x1080. There are some offsets in other resolutions, unfortunately. But they aren't very noticeable.

16:10 - Yes. Everything should work for the most part. There are some offsets in other resolutions, unfortunately.

4:3 - Yes. Everything should work for the most part. There are some offsets in other resolutions, unfortunately.

To-Do
---------
comp menu / elements
change class select / team select / charinfoloadoutsubpanel to fit the style of the main menu
Find a way to make it so when you're ingame, there aren't transparent top and bottom bars on the class / backpack / crafting menus

Changelog
----------

May 25 2016
- Release

May 31 2016
- Added 16:10 support. Made quickplay result dialog wider.

June 2 2016
- Added full MvM support. Essentials should be edited, and the HUD should be usable. Please let me know if I messed something up, I don't play MvM often.

June 3 2016
- New backpack, crafting, and class loadout menus. The hud is not as VTF reliant as much now. This should be able to be used in all resolutions. 4:3 support is coming very soon, seeing as there are very few things I have to fix up. Unfortunately, I had to move the stream panel down by like, 15 pixels. Hopefully it doesn't detract much from the look.
